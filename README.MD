Basic model of bandwidth of simultaneous point to point messages on a cluster divided into islands
use python run.py to run two examples:
1. two island simulation with multiple pairs sending simultaneously, each rank in a pair in a different island
2. 3 island simulation with 64 ranks sending simultanously, paired off at increasing distances from distance 1 to distance 32
